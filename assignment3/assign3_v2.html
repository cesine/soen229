<h1>Programming Assignment 3</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

So far we have been using Perl for scripts that a user might want to use at a command line.  In this Assignment we will move from local users, to non-local users.

<p>
Assign 3: simplistic Web Server
<ol>
<li>	Read an HTTP request out of STDIN
<li>	Output a corresponding HTTP response to STDOUT
<li> 	Log the server activities
</ol>
</p>

Your server will be tested with plain html files and with a server-side script. Your server should be able to act differently in the two cases. In the case of a normal file it will print out an HTTP response consisting of some headers and then the contents of the file. In the case of a server-side script it will run the script to generate the contents of the HTTP response.

<h2>1 Read an HTTP request</h2>

<h3>1.1 A data structure to hold the HTTP request information</h3>

<p>
An HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) request at it's most basic is a command like
<blockquote>
GET /somedirectory/filename.html  </blockquote></p>



Here are some common variables that a websever needs to know. ( <a href="#Details">Click here for details</a>

<ul>
<li>Content-Length
<li>Content-Type
<li>Document-Root
<li>Query-String
<li>Request-Method
<li>Server-Name
<li>Server-Protocol
<li>Server-Software
</ul>


<p>
Store these variables and their values into a hash in your Perl script. Perl has a special hash for this purpose, its called %ENV.
</p>


<h3>1.2 Formatting the hash key value pairs</h3>
For each variable value pair you will need to convert the letters to uppercase and replace - by _. For help doing this see the <a href="">tutorial on regular expressions.</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<table border="1"><tr><td>
</td><td>
variable</td><td>
value</td></tr><tr><td>
HTTP Request</td><td>
Request-Method: </td><td>
Get
</td></tr></table>

</p>
Would be inserted into your %ENV as a key value pair.

<table border="1"><tr><td>
Perl script</td><td>
$ENV{REQUEST-METHOD} = 'GET';
</td></tr></table>

</blockquote>


<p>

Your server will have to process a CGI script written in Perl. The CGI will use some additional variables which you should also store in your %ENV, but prefix their keys with HTTP_ to keep them distinct from the standard ones above.

<blockquote>
<p>
<table border="1"><tr><td>
</td><td>
variable</td><td>
value</td></tr><tr><td>
HTTP Request</td><td>
File-for-upload: </td><td>
heresmyassignment.zip
</td></tr></table>

</p>
Would be inserted into your %ENV as a key value pair.
<p>
<table border="1"><tr><td>
Perl script</td><td>
$ENV{HTTP_FILE_FOR_UPLOAD} = 'heresmyassignment.zip';
</td></tr></table>

</blockquote>

</p>

<h2>2 Print the HTTP response</h2>

<h3>2.1 Locate the file</h3>

<p>Like your command line interpreter you have a path variable to say where your files are, however in this case its called a Document-Root. </p>

<p>
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) on the internet is composed of 2 primary parts:

<table border="1"><tr><td>
1</td><td>
2</td></tr><tr><td>
The doman name which is licensed to you,</td><td>
The path to the file on the server that should be displayed. </td></tr><tr><td>
Eg: <a href="http://www.whois.net/whois_new3.cgi?d=concordia&tld=ca"> concordia.ca</a>
</td><td>
Eg. <a href="http://concordia.ca/info/futurestudents/undergraduate/">info/futurestudents/undergraduate/</a>
</td></tr></table>

A path on a server is also composed of 2 primary parts:

<table border="1"><tr><td>
1</td><td>
2</td></tr><tr><td>
The server root</td><td>
The path to the file on the server that should be displayed. </td></tr><tr><td>
Eg: /www/home/c/c_concordia</td><td>
Eg. info/futurestudents/undergraduate/index.html
</td></tr></table>

<p>
If the user gives a path to a directory, the script should display the "index.html" in that directory if there is one.
</p>

<p>Before you open the file be sure that it exists and that the "world" has permission to read it. You will need to reuse some of your code in Assignment 2 to check the permisions on the file before you open it.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Content Type and Content Length</h3>


Before you can print out the contents of the file, you need to print out some headers so that the browser will know how to display the contents. The Content-Type you can figure out from the extension of the file which the user requested. The Content-Length 	 The length (in bytes) of the body of the HTTP request, you need **** to figure this out.


<blockquote>
Here are some common file extensions and their matching Content-Type:

<table><tbody><tr><th> Extension </th><th> Content-Type </th></tr><tr><td> <strong>.html</strong> </td><td> text/html </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.htm</strong> </td><td> text/html </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.css</strong> </td><td> text/css </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.txt</strong> </td><td> text/plain </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.xml</strong> </td><td> text/xml </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.gif</strong> </td><td> image/gif </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.jpeg</strong> </td><td> image/jpeg </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.jpg</strong> </td><td> image/jpeg </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.png</strong> </td><td> image/png </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.mp3</strong> </td><td> audio/mpeg </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>.pdf</strong> </td><td> application/pdf </td></tr><tr><td> <em>other</em> </td><td> application/octet-stream </td></tr></tbody></table></p>

</blockquote>

<p> Sample perl script<br/>
<blockquote>
<table border="1"><tr><td>
Perl script</td><td>
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";<br/>
print "Content-length: *****\n\n";
</td></tr></table>

</blockquote>



<h3>2.3 Request non-CGI pages</h3>

Requesting non .cgi pages will be done as described above. If there are problems y ou will need generate error pages.

<h4>2.3.1 Errors </h4>

<p>Your error pages should contain an error code, a message about what the problem might be and the server information. Try creating errors on the Concordia servers and see the kinds of information they print <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~v_cook/looking">http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~v_cook/looking</a> HINT: you should be able to replicate this information using the information you stored in %ENV.
</p>
Error pages:
<ul>
<li> If the file doesn't exist generate a "404 Not Found" page instead of the file body.
<li> If there is a problem with the file's permissions generate a "403 Forbidden" page instead of the file body.
<li> If the Request-Method is anything other than GET generate a "405 Method Not Allowed" page instead of the file body.
<li> If the HTTP request is invalid (bad format) generate a "400 Bad Request" page instead of the file body.
</ul>


<h3>2.4 Request for CGI (Server-Side Scripts)</h3>

***Some of them dont know HTML, and dont know how to make forms, and now need to learn the difference between Get and Post, all while using a textual browser??  I propose we provide the script so that they dont have to debug html but yet they still have to understand the difference between get and post*****

<p>
Your server will have to process a server side script. A server side script written in Perl is called a ‘.cgi’ script and uses the .cgi extension instead of .pl It will ask the user for a file to upload  and save onto the server.
</p>

<p>
For bonus marks you can write the upload script yourself (if you know HTML and webforms), or you can test the server with the sample uploadfile.cgi we have provided.
</p>

<p>
A CGI script will generate the content of the page rather than just display it, so you need to follow a different procedure than for the other context types.  If the .cgi script is executable output a status line and then system() to execute the script. The script will generate the Content-Type header and the body of the response.



<blockquote>

<ul><li> if the request method was GET, the response&#8217;s body should be a <span class="caps">HTML</span> content which includes a file upload form; submitting the form should send a <span class="caps">POST</span> request to the same cgi file.</li><li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cknuckles.com/webapps/chap01/figures/fig1.10.gif">See here for the difference between GET and POST</a>
</p>
If the request method was POST, and the request body contains data
needed for a file upload, the data should be read out of the body and
the uploaded file should be save somewhere in the document root. The
response body should be <span class="caps">HTML</span> content
explaining the file has been uploaded; where it was uploaded to, as
well as provide a link to download it again. If the request body does
not contain data needed for a file upload, the response should be no
different than that for a <span class="caps">GET</span> request.</li></ul>

</blockquote>

<h4>2.4.1 Errors</h4>

<ul>
<li> If cgi is not executable  generate a "500 Internal Server Error" page instead of the file body.
</ul>


 <h2>3 	Keep a Logfile</h2>
<p>
If your script is run with an &#8216;l&#8217; option set, it should write to a log
file. Since your script only runs for the duration of one request, it
must <strong>append</strong> output to the logfile. Every time your script is invoked, it must append a line to the logfiel similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="code"><code>[10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] &#8220;GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0&#8221; 200 2326 &#8220;Mozilla/4.08 [en] (Win98; I ;Nav)&#8221;</code></pre>

<p>
This logging includes the following information:</p><ul><li> The current time and date when the script finished responding to the request, in braces, &#8216;[&#8217; and &#8216;]&#8217;.</li><li> The request line from the Http Request (in quotations).</li><li> The numeric part of the response&#8217;s status code.</li><li> The size &#8211; in bytes &#8211; of the Http response&#8217;s body.</li><li> The value of the User-Agent header from the request.</li></ul><p></p>
