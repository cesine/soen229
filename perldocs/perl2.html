			<P><A NAME="IXT-4-336058"></A><A NAME="IXT-4-336059"></A>Perl
			tends to be a pretty permissive language. But maybe you want Perl
			to impose a little discipline; that can be arranged with the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">use
			strict</FONT></TT> pragma. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-4-336060"></A><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff99">A
			<I>pragma</I> is a hint to a compiler</SPAN>, telling it something
			about the code. In this case, the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">use
			strict</FONT></TT> pragma tells Perl's internal compiler that it
			should enforce some good programming rules for the rest of this
			block or source file. 
			</P>
			<P>Why would this be important? Well, imagine that you're
			composing your program, and you type a line like this one: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$bamm_bamm = 3;  # Perl creates that variable automatically</FONT></PRE><P>
			Now, you keep typing for a while. After that line has scrolled off
			the top of the screen, you type this line to increment the
			variable: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$bammbamm += 1;  # Oops!</FONT></PRE><P>
			<A NAME="IXT-4-336061"></A><A NAME="IXT-4-336062"></A>Since Perl
			sees a new variable name (the underscore is significant in a
			variable name), it creates a new variable and increments that one.
			If you're lucky and smart, you've turned on warnings, and <SPAN STYLE="background: #7da647">Perl
			can tell you that you used one or both of those global variable
			names only once in your program. </SPAN>But if you're merely
			smart, you used each name more than once, and Perl won't be able
			to warn you. 
			</P>
			<P>To tell Perl that you're ready to be more restrictive, put the
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">use strict</FONT></TT> pragma at the top
			of your program (or in any block or file where you want to enforce
			these rules): 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">use strict;  # Enforce some good programming rules</FONT></PRE><P>
			Now, among other restrictions,<A HREF="#">[19]</A> <SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e">Perl
			will insist that you declare every new variable with </SPAN><TT><SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my</FONT></SPAN></TT>:<A HREF="#">[20]</A>
						</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[19]</SUP> To
			learn about the other restrictions, see the documentation for
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">strict</FONT></TT>. The documentation
			for any pragma is filed under that pragma's name, so the command
			perldoc strict(or your system's native documentation method)
			should find it for you. In brief, the other restrictions require
			that strings be quoted in most cases, and that references be true
			(hard) references. Neither of these restrictions should affect
			beginners in Perl.</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[20]</SUP>
			There are some other ways to declare variables, too.</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $bamm_bamm = 3;  # New lexical variable</FONT></PRE><P>
			Now if you try to spell it the other way, Perl can complain that
			you haven't declared any variable called <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$bammbamm</FONT></TT>,
			so your mistake is automatically caught at compile time. 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$bammbamm += 1;  # No such variable: Compile time error</FONT></PRE><P>
			Of course, this applies only to new variables; Perl's builtin
			variables, such as <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">@_</FONT></TT>
			never need to be declared.<A HREF="#">[21]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[21]</SUP>
			And, at least in some circumstances, <TT><SPAN STYLE="background: #5c8526"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a</FONT></SPAN></TT><SPAN STYLE="background: #5c8526">
			and </SPAN><TT><SPAN STYLE="background: #5c8526"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$b</FONT></SPAN></TT>
			won't need to be declared, <SPAN STYLE="background: #5c8526">because
			they're used internally by </SPAN><TT><SPAN STYLE="background: #5c8526"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">sort</FONT></SPAN></TT><SPAN STYLE="background: #5c8526">.</SPAN>
			So if you're testing this feature, use other variable names than
			those two. The fact that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">use strict</FONT></TT>
			doesn't forbid these two is one of the most frequently reported
			non-bugs in Perl.</P>
			<P>If you add <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">use strict</FONT></TT> to
			an already-written program, you'll generally get a flood of
			warning messages, so it's better to use it from the start, when
			it's needed. 
			</P>
			<P>Most people recommend that<SPAN STYLE="background: #ff6633">
			programs that are longer than a screenful of text </SPAN>generally
			need <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">use strict</FONT></TT>. And we

			This works because of the rule that parentheses may always be

			<P>But don't put that subroutine declaration after the invocation,

			So, the real rule to use is this one: until you know the names of

			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[24]</SUP>
			Then again, maybe it is a mistake; you can search the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">perlfunc</FONT></TT>
			and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">perlop</FONT></TT> manpages for that
			name, though, to see whether it's the same as a builtin. And Perl

			When programmers plan to call their subroutines as if they were

			<P>The keys are strings, first of all, so instead of getting
			element number <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">3</FONT></TT> from an
			array, we'll be accessing the hash element named <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">wilma</FONT></TT>.
						</P>
			<P>These <SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e">keys are arbitrary</SPAN>
			strings&iuml;&frac34;â€”you can use any string expression for a
			hash key. And they are <SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e">unique</SPAN>

			numbered <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">3</FONT></TT>, there's only one
			hash element named <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">wilma</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-5-336072"></A>Another way to think of a hash is
			that it's like a barrel of data, where each piece of data has a
			tag attached. You can reach into the barrel and pull out any tag
			and see what piece of data is attached. But there's no &quot;first&quot;
			item in the barrel; it's just a jumble. In an array, we'd start
			with element <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">0</FONT></TT>, then element
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>, then element <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">2</FONT></TT>,
			and so on. But in a hash, there's no fixed order, no first
			element. It's just a collection of key-value pairs. 
			</P>
			<P>The keys and values are both arbitrary scalars, but the <SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e">keys
			are always converted to strings.</SPAN> So, if you used the
			numeric expression <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">50/20</FONT></TT> as
			the key,<A HREF="#">[2]</A> it would be turned into the

			which is one of the keys shown in the diagram above. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[2]</SUP>
			That's a numeric expression, not the five-character string
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;50/20&quot;</FONT></TT>. If we
			used that five-character string as a hash key, it would stay the
			same five-character string, of course.</P>
			<P>As usual, Perl's no-unnecessary-limits philosophy applies: a
			hash may be of any size, from an empty hash with zero key-value

			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm">
			<A NAME="IXT-5-3360741"></A>The given name (first name) is the

			this wouldn't work. With this hash, you can look up anyone's given
			name, and find the corresponding family name. If you use the key
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">tom</FONT></TT>, you get the value
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">phoenix</FONT></TT>.

			<A NAME="IXT-5-3360751"></A>You may know that each computer on the

			The name of the hash is like any other Perl identifier (letters,

			<P><A NAME="IXT-5-336083"></A>When choosing the name of a hash,

			</P>
			<P>Of course, the <SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">hash key may

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my @v = values %hash;</FONT></PRE><P>

			you add elements to the hash, Perl reserves the right to rearrange

			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[11]</SUP> Of

			</P>
			<P>In a scalar context, these functions give the number of

			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-5-SECT-3.2"></A>5.3.2 The each Function</H4>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-5-336098"></A>If you wish to iterate over (that

			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[13]</SUP> The

			on a list of keys from the hash; we'll see that by the end of this
			section.</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-5-336099"></A>In practice, the only way to use
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each</FONT></TT> is in a <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop, something like this: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while ( ($key, $value) = each %hash ) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;$key =&gt; $value\n&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			There's a lot going on here. First, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each
			%hash</FONT></TT> returns a key-value pair from the hash, as a
			two-element list; let's say that the key is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;c&quot;</FONT></TT>
			and the value is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">3</FONT></TT>, so the
			list is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">(&quot;c&quot;, 3)</FONT></TT>.
			That list is assigned to the list <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">($key,</FONT></TT>
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$value)</FONT></TT>, so <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$key</FONT></TT>
			becomes <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;c&quot;</FONT></TT>, and
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$value</FONT></TT> becomes <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">3</FONT></TT>.
						</P>
			<P>But that list assignment is happening in the conditional
			expression of the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop, which is a scalar context. (Specifically, it's a Boolean
			context, looking for a true/false value; and a Boolean context is
			a particular kind of scalar context.) The value of a list
			assignment in a scalar context is the number of elements in the
			source list&iuml;&frac34;â€”<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">2</FONT></TT>,
			in this case. Since <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">2</FONT></TT> is a
			true value, we enter the body of the loop and print the message <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">c
			=&gt; 3</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P>The next time through the loop, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each
			%hash</FONT></TT> gives a new key-value pair; let's say it's <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">(&quot;a&quot;,
			1)</FONT></TT> this time. (It knows to return a different pair
			than previously because it keeps track of where it is; in
			technical jargon, there's an iterator stored in with each
			hash.<A HREF="#">[14]</A>) Those two items are stored into <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">($key,
			$value)</FONT></TT>. Since the number of elements in the source
			list was again <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">2</FONT></TT>, a true
			value, the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT> condition
			is true, and the loop body runs again, telling us <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">a
			=&gt; 1</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[14]</SUP>
			Since each hash has its own private iterator, loops using <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each
			</FONT></TT>may be nested, as long as they are iterating over
			different hashes. And, as long as we're already in a footnote, we
			may as well tell you: it's unlikely you'll ever need to do so, but
			you may reset the iterator of a hash by using the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">keys
			</FONT></TT>or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">values</FONT></TT>
			function on the hash. The iterator is also automatically reset if
			a new list is stored into the entire hash, or if <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each
			</FONT></TT>has iterated through all of the items to the &quot;end&quot;
			of the hash. On the other hand, adding new key-value pairs to the
			hash while iterating over it is generally a bad idea, since that
			won't necessarily reset the iterator. That's likely to confuse
			you, your maintenance programmer, and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each
			</FONT></TT>as well.</P>
			<P>We go one more time through the loop, and by now we know what
			to expect, so it's no surprise to see <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">b
			=&gt; 2</FONT></TT> appear in the output. 
			</P>
			<P>But we knew it couldn't go on forever. Now, when Perl evaluates
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each %hash</FONT></TT>, there are no
			more key-value pairs available. So, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each</FONT></TT>
			has to return an empty list.<A HREF="#">[15]</A> The empty list is
			assigned to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">($key, $value)</FONT></TT>,
			so <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$key</FONT></TT> gets <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">undef</FONT></TT>,
			and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$value</FONT></TT> also gets <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">undef</FONT></TT>.
						</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[15]</SUP>
			It's being used in list context, so it can't return <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">undef</FONT></TT>
			to signal failure; that would be the one-element list
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">(undef)</FONT></TT>instead of the empty
			(zero-element) list <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">( )</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P>But that hardly matters, because the whole thing is being
			evaluated in the conditional expression of the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop. The value of a list assignment in a scalar context is the
			number of elements in the source list&iuml;&frac34;â€”in this
			case, that's <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">0</FONT></TT>. Since <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">0</FONT></TT>
			is a false value, the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop is done, and execution continues with the rest of the
			program. 
			</P>
			<P>Of course, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">each</FONT></TT> returns

			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">keys</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">values</FONT></TT>
			would give, incidentally; the &quot;natural&quot; order of the

			<P>At this point, you may find it helpful to see a more concrete

			<P>The Bedrock library uses a Perl program in which a hash keeps
			track of how many books each person has checked out, among other
			information: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$books{&quot;fred&quot;} = 3;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$books{&quot;wilma&quot;} = 1;</FONT></PRE><P>

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$books{&quot;pebbles&quot;} = undef;  # no books EVER checked out - a new library card</FONT></PRE><P>

			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">0</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P>There's a key in the hash for everyone who has a library card.
			For each key (that is, for each library patron), there's a value
			that is either a number of books checked out, or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">undef</FONT></TT>
			if that person's library card has never been used.

			<A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-425"></A><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-426"></A>There's
			a lot going on in that first line: we're reading the input into a

			the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT> loop. So, inside
			the body of the loop, we'll see each line, one after another, in
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$line</FONT></TT>.<A HREF="#">[3]</A>
			This is something you'll want to do fairly often, so naturally
			Perl has a shortcut for it. The shortcut looks like this: 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[3]</SUP> You
			probably noticed that we never chomped that input. In this kind of
			a loop, you can't really put <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">chomp </FONT></TT>into
			the conditional expression, so it's often the first item in the
			loop body, when it's needed. We'll see examples of that in the
			next section.</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;I saw $_&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			Now, to make this shortcut, Larry chose some useless syntax. That
			is, this is literally saying, &quot;Read a line of input, and see
			if it's true. (Normally it is.) And if it is true, enter the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop, but throw away that line of input!&quot; Larry knew that it
			was a useless thing to do; nobody should ever need to do that in a
			real Perl program. So, Larry took this useless syntax and made it
			useful. 
			</P>
			<P>What this is actually saying is that Perl should do the same
			thing as we saw in our earlier loop: it tells Perl to read the
			input into a variable, and (as long as the result was defined, so
			we haven't reached end-of file) then enter the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop. However, instead of storing the input into <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$line</FONT></TT>,
			Perl will use its favorite default variable, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>,
			just as if you had written this: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while (defined($_ = &lt;STDIN&gt;)) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;I saw $_&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			Now, before we go any further, we must be very clear about
			something: this shortcut works only if you write it just as we
			did. If you put a line-input operator anywhere else (in
			particular, as a statement all on its own) it won't read a line
			into <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT> by default. It works
			only if there's nothing but the line-input operator in the
			conditional of a <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop.<A HREF="#">[4]</A> If you put anything else into the
			conditional expression, this shortcut won't apply. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[4]</SUP>
			Well, okay, the conditional of a <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">for</FONT></TT>
			loop is just a <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			conditional in disguise, so it works there, too.</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-6-336108"></A><A NAME="IXT-6-336109"></A>There's
			no connection between the line-input operator (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&lt;STDIN&gt;</FONT></TT>)
			and Perl's favorite default variable (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>).
			In this case, though, it just happens that the input is being
			stored in that variable. 
			</P>
			<P>On the other hand, evaluating the line-input operator in a list
			context gives you all of the (remaining) lines of input as a
			list&iuml;&frac34;â€”each element of the list is one line: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;I saw $_&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			Once again, there's no connection between the line-input operator
			and Perl's favorite default variable. In this case, though, the
			default control variable for <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>. So in this loop,
			we'll see each line of input in <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>,
			one after the other. 
			</P>
			<P>That may sound familiar, and for good reason: That's the same
			behavior as the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT> loop
			would do. Isn't it? 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXTR3-36"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-37"></A>The difference is
			under the hood. In the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop, Perl reads a line of input, puts it into a variable, and
			runs the body of the loop. Then, it goes back to find another line
			of input. But in the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			loop, the line-input operator is being used in a list context
			(since <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT> needs a list
			to iterate through). So it has to read all of the input before the
			loop can start running. That difference will become apparent when
			the input is coming from your 400MB web server log file! It's
			generally best to use code like the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop's shortcut, which will process input a line at a time,
			whenever possible.

			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><A NAME="IXT-6-336110"></A>
			<SUP>[5]</SUP> The diamond operator was named by Larry's daughter,

			the new training materials he'd been writing, and complained that
			there was no spoken name for &quot;that thing&quot;. Larry didn't
			have a name for it, either. Heidi (eight years old at the time)
			quickly chimed in, &quot;That's a diamond, Daddy.&quot; So the
			name stuck. Thanks, Heidi!</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[6]</SUP> But
			not just on Unix systems. Many other systems have adopted this way
			of using invocation arguments.</P>
			<P>The <I>invocation arguments</I> to a program are normally a
			number of &quot;words&quot; on the command line after the name of
			the program.<A HREF="#">[7]</A> In this case, they give the names
			of a number of files to be processed in sequence: 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[7]</SUP>
			Whenever a program is started, it has a list of zero or more
			invocation arguments, supplied by whatever program is starting it.
			Often this is the shell, which makes up the list depending upon
			what you type on the command line. But we'll see in a later
			chapter that you can invoke a program with pretty much any strings
			as the invocation arguments. Because they often come from the
			shell's command line, they are sometimes called &quot;command-line
			arguments&quot; as well.</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$ <B>./my_program fred barney betty</B></FONT></PRE><P>
			That command means to run the command <I>my_program</I> (which

			betty. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-6-336113"></A><A NAME="IXT-6-336114"></A>If you

			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred - betty</FONT></TT>, that would

			Here's a possibly unfamilar Unix fact: most of those standard
			utilities, like <I>cat </I>and <I>sed </I>use this same

			</P>
			<P>The benefit of making your programs work like this is that you
			may choose where the program gets its input at run time; for
			example, you won't have to rewrite the program to use it in a
			pipeline (which we'll discuss more later). Larry put this feature
			into Perl because he wanted to make it easy for you to write your
			own programs that work like standard Unix utilities&iuml;&frac34;â€”even
			on non-Unix machines. Actually, he did it so he could make his own

			they'd all have the same behavior. Of course, this meant porting

			<P><A NAME="IXT-6-336115"></A>The diamond operator is actually a

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			This works like the loop above, but with less typing. And you may

			<P>Since the diamond operator is generally being used to process

			That first <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT> statement

			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[16]</SUP> You

			<P>But before you decide to always use the second form, imagine

			unchomped lines of input. That is, imagine that each of its

			Do you see where the spaces come from? Perl is interpolating an
			array, so it puts spaces between the elements. So, we get the
			first element of the array (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>
			and a newline character), then a space, then the next element of
			the array (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT> and a
			newline character), then a space, then the last element of the
			array (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">betty</FONT></TT> and a newline
			character). The result is that the lines seem to have become
			indented, except for the first one. Every week or two, a message
			appears on the newsgroup comp.lang.perl.misc with a subject line
			something like: 
			</P>
			<DL>

			<P>
			<A NAME="IXT-6-336126"></A>Without even reading the message, we
			can immediately see that the program used double quotes around an

			the answer is always yes. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-6-336127"></A><A NAME="IXT-6-336128"></A>Generally,

			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;@array\n&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
			So, if you're using the quote marks, you'll be (generally) adding

			It's normal for your program's output to be <I>buffered</I> . That
			is, instead of sending out every little bit of output at once,
			it'll be saved until there's enough to bother with. That's because
			if (for example) the output were going to be saved on disk, it
			would be (relatively) slow and inefficient to spin the disk every
			time that one or two characters need to be added to the file.
			Generally, then, the output will go into a buffer that is <I>flushed</I>
			(that is, actually written to disk, or wherever) only when the
			buffer gets full, or when the output is otherwise finished (such
			as at the end of runtime). Usually, that's what you want. 
			</P>
			<P>But if you (or a program) may be waiting impatiently for the
			output, you may wish to take that performance hit and flush the
			output buffer each time you <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>.
			See the Perl manpages for more information on controlling
			buffering in that case. 
			</P>
			<P>Since <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT> is looking
			for a list of strings to print, its arguments are evaluated in
			list context. Since the diamond operator (as a special kind of
			line-input operator) will return a list of lines in a list
			context, these can work well together: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &lt;&gt;;          # source code for 'cat'</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print sort &lt;&gt;;  # source code for 'sort'</FONT></PRE><P>
			Well, to be fair, the standard Unix commands <I>cat</I> and <I>sort</I>
			do have some additional functionality that these replacements
			lack. But you can't beat them for the price! You can now
			re-implement all of your standard Unix utilities in Perl, and
			painlessly port them to any machine that has Perl, whether that
			machine is running Unix or not. And you can be sure that the

			the same behavior.<A HREF="#">[17]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[17]</SUP> In
			fact, there was even an endeavor started, called the PPT (Perl
			Power Tools) project, whose goal is to implement all of the
			classic Unix utilities in Perl. They actually completed nearly all
			the utilities (and most of the games!), but got bogged down when
			they got to reimplementing the shell. The PPT project has been
			helpful because it has made these standard utilities available on
			many non-Unix machines.

			<P><A NAME="IXT-6-336133"></A><A NAME="IXT-6-336134"></A>What
			might not be obvious is that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>
			has optional parentheses, which can sometimes cause confusion.
			Remember the rule that parentheses in Perl may always be omitted,
			except when doing so would change the meaning of a statement. So,
			here are two ways to print the same thing: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
			So far, so good. But another rule in Perl is that if the
			invocation of <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT> looks
			like a function call, then it is a function call. It's a simple
			rule, but what does it mean for something to look like a function
			call? 
			</P>
			<P>In a function call, there's a function name immediately<A HREF="#">[18]</A>
			followed by parentheses around the function's arguments, like
			this: 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[18]</SUP> We
			say &quot;immediately&quot; here because Perl won't permit a
			newline character between the function name and the opening
			parenthesis in this kind of function call. If there is a newline
			there, Perl sees your code as making a list operator, rather than
			a function call. This is the kind of piddling technical detail
			that we mention only for completeness. If you're terminally
			curious, see the full story in the manpages.</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print (2+3);</FONT></PRE><P>
			<A NAME="IXT-6-336135"></A>That looks like a function call, so it
			is a function call. It prints <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">5</FONT></TT>,
			but then it returns a value like any other function. The return
			value of <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT> is a true or
			false value, indicating the success of the print. It nearly always
			succeeds, unless you get some I/O error, so the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$result</FONT></TT>
			in the following statement will normally be <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>:
			
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$result = print(&quot;hello world!\n&quot;);</FONT></PRE><P>
			But what if you used the result in some other way? Let's suppose
			you decide to multiply the return value times four: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print (2+3)*4;  # Oops!</FONT></PRE><P>
			When Perl sees this line of code, it prints <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">5</FONT></TT>,
			just as you asked. Then it takes the return value from <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>,
			which is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>, and multiplies
			that times <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">4</FONT></TT>. It then throws
			away the product, wondering why you didn't tell it to do something
			else with it. And at this point, someone looking over your
			shoulder says, &quot;Hey, Perl can't do math! That should have
			printed <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">20</FONT></TT>, rather than <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">5</FONT></TT>!&quot;
			
			</P>
			<P>This is the problem with allowing the parentheses to be
			optional; sometimes we humans forget where the parentheses really
			belong. When there are no parentheses, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>
			is a list operator, printing all of the items in the following
			list; that's generally what you'd expect. But when the first thing
			after <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT> is a left
			parenthesis, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT> is a
			function call, and it will print only what's found inside the
			parentheses. Since that line had parentheses, it's the same to
			Perl as if you'd said this: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">( print(2+3) ) * 4;  # Oops!</FONT></PRE><P>
			Fortunately, Perl itself can almost always help you with this, if
			you ask for warnings&iuml;&frac34;â€”so use <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">-w</FONT></TT>,
			at least during program development and debugging. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXTR3-41"></A>Actually, this rule&iuml;&frac34;â€”&quot;If
			it looks like a function call, it is a function call&quot;&iuml;&frac34;â€”applies
			to all list functions<A HREF="#">[19]</A> in Perl, not just to
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>. It's just that you're
			most likely to notice it with <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>.
			If <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT> (or another
			function name) is followed by an open parenthesis, make sure that
			the corresponding close parenthesis comes after all of the
			arguments to that function.

			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[19]</SUP>

			<P><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-491"></A>Perl has many features that
			set it apart from other languages. Of all those features, one of
			the most important is its strong support for regular expressions.
			These allow fast, flexible, and reliable string handling. 
			</P>
			<P>But that power comes at a price. Regular expressions are
			actually tiny programs in their own special language, built inside
			Perl. (Yes, you're about to learn another programming language!<A HREF="#">[1]</A>
			Fortunately it's a simple one.) So for the next two chapters,
			we'll be learning that language; then we'll take what we've
			learned back to the world of Perl in <A HREF="./%3Fxmlid=0-596-00132-0/lperl3-CHP-9#lperl3-CHP-9">Chapter
			9</A>. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[1]</SUP> Some
			might argue that regular expressions are not a complete
			programming language. We won't argue.</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336152"></A>Regular expressions aren't merely
			part of Perl; they're also found in <I>sed</I> and <I>awk</I>,
			<I>procmail</I>, <I>grep</I>, most programmers' text editors like
			<I>vi</I> and <I>emacs</I>, and even in more esoteric places. If
			you've seen some of these already, you're ahead of the game. Keep
			watching, and you'll see many more tools that use or support

			Expressions?</H3>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336153"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336154"></A>A <I>regular
			expression</I>, often called a <I>pattern</I> in Perl, is a
			template that either matches or doesn't match a given string.<A HREF="#">[2]</A>
			That is, there are an infinite number of possible text strings; a
			given pattern divides that infinite set into two groups: the ones
			that match, and the ones that don't. There's never any
			kinda-sorta-almost-up-to-here wishy-washy matching: either it
			matches or it doesn't. A pattern may match just one possible
			string, or just two or three, or a dozen, or a hundred, or an
			infinite number. Or it may match all strings except for one, or
			except for some, or except for an infinite number.<A HREF="#">[3]</A>
			
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[2]</SUP>
			Purists would ask for a more rigorous definition. But then again,
			purists say that Perl's patterns aren't really regular
			expressions. If you're serious about regular expressions, we
			highly recommend the book Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey
			Friedl (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.).</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[3]</SUP> And
			as we'll see, you could have a pattern that always matches or that
			never does. In rare cases, even these may be useful. Generally,
			though, they're mistakes.</P>
			<P>We already referred to regular expressions as being little
			programs in their own simple programming language. It's a simple
			language because the programs have just one task: to look at a
			string and say &quot;it matches&quot; or &quot;it doesn't
			match&quot;.<A HREF="#">[4]</A> That's all they do. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[4]</SUP> The
			programs also pass back some information that Perl can use later.
			One such piece of information is the &quot;regular expressions
			memories&quot; that we'll learn about a little later.</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336155"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336156"></A>One of
			the places you're likely to have seen regular expressions is in
			the Unix <I>grep</I> command, which prints out text lines matching
			a given pattern. For example, if you wanted to see which lines in
			a given file mention <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">flint</FONT></TT>
			and, somewhere later on the same line, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">stone</FONT></TT>,
			you might do something like this, with the Unix <I>grep</I>
			command: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$ <B>grep 'flint.*stone' some_file</B></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">a piece of flint, a stone which may be used to start a fire by striking</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">found obsidian, flint, granite, and small stones of basaltic rock, which</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">a flintlock rifle in poor condition. The sandstone mantle held several</FONT></PRE><P>
			Now, if you've used regular expressions somewhere else, that's
			good, because you have a head start on these three chapters. But
			Perl's regular expressions have somewhat different syntax than
			most other implementations; in fact, everybody's regular
			expressions are a little different. So, if you needed to use a
			backslash to do something in another implementation, maybe you'll
			need to leave it off in Perl, or maybe vice versa. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336157"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336158"></A>Don't
			confuse regular expressions with shell filename-matching patterns,
			called <I>globs</I>. A typical glob is what you use when you type
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">*.pm</FONT></TT> to the Unix shell to
			match all filenames that end in <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">.pm</FONT></TT>.
			Globs use a lot of the same characters that we use in regular
			expressions, but those characters are used in totally different
			ways.<A HREF="#">[5]</A> We'll visit globs later, in <A HREF="./%3Fxmlid=0-596-00132-0/lperl3-CHP-12#lperl3-CHP-12">Chapter
			12</A>, but for now try to put them totally out of your mind. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[5]</SUP>
			Globs are also (alas) sometimes called patterns. What's worse,
			though, is that some bad Unix books for beginners (and possibly
			written by beginners) have taken to calling globs &quot;regular
			expressions&quot;, which they certainly are not. This confuses
			many folks at the start of their work with Unix.</P>

			more than once, but that doesn't make any difference. If it's
			found at all, it's a match; if it's not in there at all, it fails.
			
			</P>
			<P>Because the pattern match is generally being used to return a
			true or false value, it is almost always found in the conditional
			expression of <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT> or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>.
			
			</P>
			<P>All of the usual backslash escapes that you can put into

			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-7-SECT-2.1"></A>7.2.1 About Metacharacters</H4>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336161"></A>Of course, if patterns matched only
			simple literal strings, they wouldn't be very useful. That's why
			there are a number of special characters, called <I>metacharacters</I>,
			that have special meanings in regular expressions. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336162"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336163"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336164"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336165"></A>
			For example, the dot (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">.</FONT></TT>) is
			a wildcard character&iuml;&frac34;â€”it matches any single
			character except a newline (which is represented by <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;\n&quot;</FONT></TT>).
			So, the pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/bet.y/</FONT></TT>
			would match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">betty</FONT></TT>. Or it
			would match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">betsy</FONT></TT>, or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bet=y</FONT></TT>,
			or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bet.y</FONT></TT>, or any other
			string that has <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bet</FONT></TT>,
			followed by any one character (except a newline), followed by <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">y</FONT></TT>.
			It wouldn't match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bety</FONT></TT> or
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">betsey</FONT></TT>, though, since those
			don't have exactly one character between the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">t</FONT></TT>
			and the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">y</FONT></TT>. The dot always
			matches exactly one character. 
			</P>
			<P>So, if you wanted to match a period in the string, you could
			use the dot. But that would match any possible character (except a
			newline), which might be more than you wanted. If you wanted the
			dot to match just a period, you can simply backslash it. In fact,
			that rule goes for all of Perl's regular expression
			metacharacters: a backslash in front of any metacharacter makes it
			nonspecial. So, the pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/3\.14159/</FONT></TT>
			doesn't have a wildcard character. 
			</P>
			<P>So the backslash is our second metacharacter. If you mean a
			real backslash, just use a pair of them&iuml;&frac34;â€”a rule
			that applies just as well everywhere else in Perl. 
			</P>
			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-7-SECT-2.2"></A>7.2.2 Simple Quantifiers</H4>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336166"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336167"></A>It often
			happens that you'll need to repeat something in a pattern. The
			star (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">*</FONT></TT>) means to match the
			preceding item zero or more times. So, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/fred\t*barney/</FONT></TT>
			matches any number of tab characters between <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>
			and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT>. That is, it
			matches <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;fred\tbarney&quot;</FONT></TT>
			with one tab, or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;fred\t\tbarney&quot;</FONT></TT>
			with two tabs, or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;fred\t\t\tbarney&quot;</FONT></TT>
			with three tabs, or even <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;fredbarney&quot;</FONT></TT>
			with nothing in between at all. That's because the star means
			&quot;zero or more&quot;&iuml;&frac34;â€”so you could even have
			hundreds of tab characters in between, but nothing other than
			tabs. You may find it helpful to think of star as saying, &quot;that
			previous thing, any number of times, even zero times.&quot; 
			</P>
			<P>What if you wanted to allow something besides tab characters?
			The dot matches any character<A HREF="#">[6]</A>, so <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">.*</FONT></TT>
			will match any character, any number of times. That means that the
			pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/fred.*barney/</FONT></TT>
			matches &quot;any old junk&quot; between <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>
			and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT>. Any line that
			mentions <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT> and (somewhere
			later) <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT> will match
			that pattern. We often call <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">.*</FONT></TT>
			the &quot;any old junk&quot; pattern, because it can match any old
			junk in your strings. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[6]</SUP>
			Except newline. But we're going to stop reminding you of that so
			often, because you know it by now. Most of the time it doesn't
			matter, anyway, because your strings will most-often not have
			newlines. But don't forget this detail, because someday a newline
			will sneak into your string and you'll need to remember that the
			dot doesn't match newline.</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336168"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336169"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336170"></A>
			The star is formally called a <I>quantifier</I>, meaning that it
			specifies a quantity of the preceding item. But it's not the only
			quantifier; the plus (&quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">+</FONT></TT>&quot;)
			is another. The plus means to match the preceding item one or more
			times: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/fred +barney/</FONT></TT>
			matches if <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT>
			are separated by spaces and only spaces. (The space is not a
			metacharacter.) This won't match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fredbarney</FONT></TT>,
			since the plus means that there must be one or more spaces between
			the two names, so at least one space is required. It may be
			helpful to think of the plus as saying, &quot;that last thing,
			plus any number more of the same thing.&quot; 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336171"></A><A NAME="IXT-7-336172"></A>There's a
			third quantifier like the star and plus, but more limited. It's
			the question mark (&quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">?</FONT></TT>&quot;),
			which means that the preceding item is optional. That is, the
			preceding item may occur once or not at all. Like the other two
			quantifiers, the question mark means that the preceding item
			appears a certain number of times. It's just that in this case the
			item may match one time (if it's there) or zero times (if it's
			not). There aren't any other possibilities. So, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/bamm-?bamm/</FONT></TT>
			matches either spelling: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bamm-bamm</FONT></TT>
			or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bammbamm</FONT></TT>. This is easy to
			remember, since it's saying &quot;that last thing, maybe? Or maybe
			not?&quot; 
			</P>
			<P>All three of these quantifiers must follow something, since
			they tell how many times the previous item may repeat.

			matches strings like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">freddddddddd</FONT></TT>,

			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[7]</SUP> The

			A.6</A> for answers to the following exercises: 
			</P>
			<P>Remember, it's normal to be surprised by some of the things

			in this chapter are even more important than the others. Expect
			the unexpected. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-7-336179"></A>Several of these exercises ask you
			to use the test program from this chapter. You could manually type
			up this program, taking great care to get all of the odd
			punctuation marks correct.<A HREF="#">[10]</A> But you'll probably
			find it faster and easier to simply download the program and some
			other goodies from the O'Reilly website, as we mentioned in the
			Preface. You'll find this program under the name <I>pattern_test</I>.<A HREF="#">[11]</A>
			
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[10]</SUP> If
			you do type it up on your own, remember that the backtick
			character (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">`</FONT></TT>) is not the
			same as the apostrophe (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">'</FONT></TT>).
			On most full-sized computer keyboards these days (in the U.S., at
			least), the backtick is found on a key immediately to the left of
			the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT> key. Try out the
			program with the pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/match/</FONT></TT>and
			the string <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">beforematchafter</FONT></TT>,
			as the text describes, and see that it works correctly before you
			do the exercises.</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[11]</SUP>
			Don't be surprised if the program you download is a little fancier
			than what we have in the book. The commented-out extra features
			you see will come in handy in later exercises.</P>

			<P><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-523"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336180"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336181"></A>
			A <I>character class</I>, a list of possible characters inside
			square brackets (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[]</FONT></TT>),
			matches any single character from within the class. It matches
			just one single character, but that one character may be any of
			the ones listed. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336182"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336183"></A>For
			example, the character class <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[abcwxyz]</FONT></TT>
			may match any one of those seven characters. For convenience, you
			may specify a range of characters with a hyphen (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">-</FONT></TT>),
			so that class may also be written as <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[a-cw-z]</FONT></TT>.
			That didn't save much typing, but it's more usual to make a
			character class like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[a-zA-Z]</FONT></TT>,
			to match any one letter out of that set of 52.<A HREF="#">[1]</A>
			You may use the same character shortcuts as in any double-quotish
			string to define a character, so the class <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[\000-\177]</FONT></TT>
			matches any seven-bit ASCII character.<A HREF="#">[2]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[1]</SUP>
			Notice that those 52 don't include letters like &Aring; and &Eacute;
			and &Icirc; and &Oslash; and &Uuml;. But when Unicode processing
			is available, that particular character range is noticed and
			enhanced to automatically do the right thing.</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[2]</SUP> At
			least, if you use ASCII and not EBCDIC.</P>
			<P>Of course, a character class will be just part of a full
			pattern; it will never stand on its own in Perl. For example, you
			might see code that says something like this: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_ = &quot;The HAL-9000 requires authorization to continue.&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if (/HAL-[0-9]+/) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;The string mentions some model of HAL computer.\n&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			Sometimes, it's easier to specify the characters left out, rather
			than the ones within the character class. A caret (&quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">^</FONT></TT>&quot;)
			at the start of the character class negates it. That is, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[^def]</FONT></TT>
			will match any single character except one of those three. And
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[^n\-z]</FONT></TT> matches any
			character except for <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">n</FONT></TT>,
			hyphen, or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">z</FONT></TT>. (Note that the
			hyphen is backslashed, because it's special inside a character
			class. But the first hyphen in <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/HAL-[0-9]+/</FONT></TT>
			doesn't need a backslash, because hyphens aren't special outside a
			character class.) 
			</P>
			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-8-SECT-1.1"></A>8.1.1 Character Class
			Shortcuts</H4>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336184"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336185"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336186"></A>
			Some character classes appear so frequently that they have
			shortcuts. For example, the character class for any digit, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[0-9]</FONT></TT>,
			may be abbreviated as <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\d</FONT></TT> .
			Thus, the pattern from the example about HAL could be written
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/HAL-\d+/</FONT></TT> instead. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336187"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336188"></A>The
			shortcut <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\w</FONT></TT> is a so-called
			&quot;word&quot; character: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[A-Za-z0-9_]</FONT></TT>.
			If your &quot;words&quot; are made up of ordinary letters, digits,
			and underscores, you'll be happy with this. Most of the rest of us
			have words made up of ordinary letters, hyphens, and
			apostrophes,<A HREF="#">[3]</A> and we'd like to change this. As
			of this writing, the Perl developers are working on it, but it's
			not available yet.<A HREF="#">[4]</A> So use this one only when
			you want ordinary letters, digits, and underscores. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[3]</SUP> At
			least, in usual English we do. In other languages, you may have
			different components of words. And when looking at ASCII-encoded
			English text, we have the problem that the single quote and the
			apostrophe are the same character, so it's not possible in
			isolation to tell whether <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">cats'</FONT></TT>
			is a word with an apostrophe or a word at the end of a quotation.
			This is probably one reason that computers haven't been able to
			take over the world yet.</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[4]</SUP>
			Except to a limited (but nevertheless useful) extent in connection
			with locales; see the perllocale manpage.</P>
			<P>Of course, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\w</FONT></TT> doesn't
			match a &quot;word&quot;; it merely matches a single &quot;word&quot;
			character. To match an entire word, though, the plus modifier is
			handy. A pattern like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/fred \w+ barney/</FONT></TT>
			will match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT> and a space,
			then a &quot;word&quot;, then a space and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT>.
			That is, it'll match if there's one word<A HREF="#">[5]</A>
			between <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT>,
			set off by single spaces. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[5]</SUP>
			We're going to stop saying &quot;word&quot; in quotes so much; you
			know by now that these letter-digit-underscore words are the ones
			we mean.</P>

			As you may have noticed in that previous example, it might be
			handy to be able to match spaces more flexibly. The <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\s</FONT></TT>
			shortcut is good for whitespace; it's the same as <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[\f\t\n\r
			]</FONT></TT>. That is, it's the same as a class containing the
			five whitespace characters form-feed, tab, newline, carriage
			return, and the space character itself. These are the characters
			that merely move the printing position around; they don't use any
			ink. Still, like the other shortcuts we've just seen, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\s</FONT></TT>
			matches just a single character from the class, so it's usual to
			use either <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\s*</FONT></TT> for any
			amount of whitespace (including none at all), or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\s+</FONT></TT>
			for one or more whitespace characters. (In fact, it's rare to see
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\s</FONT></TT> without one of those
			quantifiers.) Since all of those whitespace characters look about
			the same to us humans, we can treat them all in the same way with
			this shortcut. 
			</P>
			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-8-SECT-1.2"></A>8.1.2 Negating the

			Sometimes you may want the opposite of one of these three
			shortcuts. That is, you may want <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[^\d]</FONT></TT>,
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[^\w]</FONT></TT>, or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[^\s]</FONT></TT>,
			meaning a nondigit character, a nonword character, or a
			nonwhitespace character. That's easy enough to accomplish by using
			their uppercase counterparts: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\D</FONT></TT>,
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\W</FONT></TT>, or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\S</FONT></TT>.
			These match any character that their counterpart would not match. 
			</P>
			<P>Any of these shortcuts will work either in place of a character
			class (standing on their own in a pattern), or inside the square
			brackets of a larger character class. That means that you could
			now use <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/[\dA-Fa-f]+/</FONT></TT> to
			match hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, which use letters <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">ABCDEF</FONT></TT>
			(or the same letters in lowercase) as additional digits. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXTR3-50"></A>Another compound character class is
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[\d\D]</FONT></TT>, which means any
			digit, or any non-digit. That is to say, any character at all!
			This is a common way to match any character, even a newline. (As
			opposed to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">.</FONT></TT>, which matches
			any character except a newline.) And then there's the totally
			useless <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">[^\d\D]</FONT></TT>, which
			matches anything that's not either a digit or a non-digit.
			Right&iuml;&frac34;â€”nothing!

			<H3><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-8-SECT-2"></A>8.2 General Quantifiers</H3>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336198"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336199"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336200"></A>
			A <I>quantifier</I> in a pattern means to repeat the preceding
			item a certain number of times. We've already seen three
			quantifiers: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">*</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">+</FONT></TT>,
			and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">?</FONT></TT>. But if none of those
			three suits your needs, just use a comma-separated pair of numbers
			inside curly braces (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">{}</FONT></TT>) to
			specify exactly how few and how many repetitions are allowed. 
			</P>
			<P>So the pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/a{5,15}/</FONT></TT>
			will match from five to fifteen repetitions of the letter <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">a</FONT></TT>.
			If the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">a</FONT></TT> appears three
			times, that's too few, so it won't match. If it appears five
			times, it's a match. If it appears ten times, that's still a
			match. If it appears twenty times, just the first fifteen will
			match, since that's the upper limit. 
			</P>
			<P>If you omit the second number (but include the comma), there's
			no upper limit to the number of times the item will match. So,
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/(fred){3,}/</FONT></TT> will match if
			there are three or more instances of <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>
			in a row (with no extra characters, like spaces, allowed between
			each <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT> and the next).
			There's no upper limit, so that would match eighty-eight instances
			of <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>, if you had a string
			with that many. 
			</P>
			<P>If you omit the comma as well as the upper bound, the number
			given is an exact count: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/\w{8}/</FONT></TT>
			will match exactly eight word characters (occuring as part of a
			larger string, perhaps). 
			</P>
			<P>In fact, the three quantifier characters that we saw earlier
			are just common shortcuts. The star is the same as the quantifier
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">{0,}</FONT></TT>, meaning zero or more.
			The plus is the same as <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">{1,}</FONT></TT>,
			meaning one or more. And the question mark could be written as
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">{0,1}</FONT></TT>. In practice, it's
			unusual to need any curly-brace quantifiers, since the three
			shortcut characters are nearly always the only ones needed.

			<H3><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-8-SECT-3"></A>8.3 Anchors</H3>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336201"></A>By default, if a pattern doesn't
			match at the start of the string, it can &quot;float&quot; on down
			the string, trying to match somewhere else. But there are a number
			of anchors that may be used to hold the pattern at a particular
			point in a string. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336202"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336203"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336204"></A>
			The caret<A HREF="#">[6]</A> anchor (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">^</FONT></TT>)
			marks the beginning of the string, while the dollar sign (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$</FONT></TT>)
			marks the end.<A HREF="#">[7]</A> So the pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/^fred/</FONT></TT>
			will match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT> only at the
			start of the string; it wouldn't match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">manfred
			mann</FONT></TT>. And <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/rock$/</FONT></TT>
			will match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">rock</FONT></TT> only at the
			end of the string; it wouldn't match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">knute
			rockne</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[6]</SUP> Yes,
			you've seen that caret is already used in another way in patterns.
			As the first character of a character class, it negates the class.
			But outside of a character class, it's a metacharacter in a
			different way, being the start-of-string anchor. There are only so
			many characters, so we have to use some of them twice.</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[7]</SUP>
			Actually, it matches either the end of the string, or at a newline
			at the end of the string. That's so that you can match the end of
			the string whether it has a trailing newline or not. Most folks
			don't worry about this distinction much, but once in a long while
			it's important to remember that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/^fred$/</FONT></TT>will
			match either <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;fred&quot;</FONT></TT>
			or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;fred\n&quot;</FONT></TT> with
			equal ease.</P>
			<P>Sometimes, you'll want to use both of these anchors, to ensure
			that the pattern matches an entire string. A common example is
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/^\s*$/</FONT></TT>, which matches a
			blank line. But this &quot;blank&quot; line may include some
			whitespace characters, like tabs and spaces, which are invisible
			to you and me. Any line that matches that pattern looks just like
			any other one on paper, so this pattern treats all blank lines as
			equivalent. Without the anchors, it would match nonblank lines as
			well.

			<P><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-555"></A><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-556"></A>
			You remember that parentheses (&quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">(
			)</FONT></TT>&quot;) may be used for grouping together parts of a
			pattern. They also have a second function: they tell the regular
			expression engine to remember what was in the substring matched by
			the pattern in the parentheses. That is to say, it doesn't
			remember what was in the pattern itself; it remembers what was in
			the corresponding part of the string. Whenever you use parentheses
			for grouping, they automatically work as memory parentheses as
			well. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336210"></A>So, if you use <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/./</FONT></TT>,
			you'll match any single character (except newline); if you use
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/(.)/</FONT></TT>, you'll still match
			any single character, but now it will be kept in a regular
			expression memory. For each pair of parentheses in the pattern,
			you'll have one regular expression memory. 
			</P>
			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-8-SECT-4.1"></A>8.4.1 Backreferences</H4>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336211"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336212"></A><A NAME="IXT-8-336213"></A>
			A <I>backreference</I> refers back to a memory that was saved
			earlier in the current pattern's processing. Backreferences are
			made with a backslash, which is easy to remember. For example, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\1</FONT></TT>
			contains the first regular expression memory (that is, the part of
			the string matched by the first pair of parentheses). 
			</P>
			<P>Backreferences are used to go back and match the exact same<A HREF="#">[10]</A>
			string that was matched earlier in the pattern. So, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/(.)\1/</FONT></TT>
			means to match any one character, remember it as memory one, then
			match memory one again. In other words, match any character,
			followed by the same character. So, this pattern will match
			strings with doubled-letters, as in <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bamm-bamm</FONT></TT>
			and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">betty</FONT></TT>. Of course, the
			dot will match characters other than letters, so if a string has
			two spaces in a row, two tabs in a row, or two asterisks in a row,
			it will match. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[10]</SUP>
			Well, if the pattern is case-insensitive, as we'll learn in the
			next chapter, the capitalization doesn't have to match. Other than
			that, though, the string must be the same.</P>
			<P>That's not the same as the pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/../</FONT></TT>,
			which will match any character followed by any character&iuml;&frac34;â€”those
			two could be the same, or they could be different. <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/(.)\1/</FONT></TT>
			means to match any character followed by the same character. 
			</P>
			<P>A typical usage of these memories might be if you have some
			HTML-like<A HREF="#">[11]</A> text to process. For example, maybe
			you want to match a tag like these two, which may use either
			single quotes or double quotes: 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[11]</SUP>
			These examples are intentionally <I>not</I> HTML, because there
			are too many tricky things that crop up in real HTML, or any
			similar markup language like XML or SGML. If you need to work with
			HTML, don't use simple patterns like these. Get a robust module
			from CPAN, so that you can start with code that's already written
			and debugged. If you don't, we promise that you'll be sorry. Don't
			say we didn't warn you.</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&lt;image source='fred.png'&gt;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&lt;image source=&quot;fred's-birthday.png&quot;&gt;</FONT></PRE><P>
			The tag may have either single quotes or double quotes, since the
			quoted data may include the other kind of mark (as with the
			apostrophe in the second example tag). So the pattern might look
			like this: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/&lt;image
			source=(['&quot;]).*\1&gt;/</FONT></TT>. That says that the
			opening quote mark may be of either type, but there must be a
			matching mark at the end of the quote.<A HREF="#">[12]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[12]</SUP> If
			you realize that there may be problems with using this pattern on
			a markup language like HTML, that's okay. There are lots of
			problems with that! This is just an example to illustrate a use of
			a backreference. You shouldn't use simple patterns to parse
			anything as complex as HTML anyway.</P>
			<P>If you have more sets of parentheses, you can have more
			backreferences. As you might guess, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\17</FONT></TT>
			is the contents of the seventeenth regular expression memory, if
			you have at least that many sets of parentheses.<A HREF="#">[13]</A>
			
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[13]</SUP> If
			you don't have that many sets of parentheses before that point in
			the pattern, backreferences <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\10</FONT></TT>
			and beyond will be treated as octal character escapes. To keep an
			octal character escape like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\12</FONT></TT>
			from accidentally meaning a backreference, just use a leading
			zero: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\012</FONT></TT> is always a
			character, never a backreference.</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-8-336214"></A>In numbering backreferences, you can
			just count the left (opening) parentheses. The
			pattern<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/((fred|wilma) (flintstone)) \1/</FONT></TT>
			says to match strings like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">flintstone fred flintstone</FONT></TT>,
			since the first opening parenthesis and its corresponding closing
			parenthesis hold a pattern that matches <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred
			flintstone</FONT></TT>.<A HREF="#">[14]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[14]</SUP>
			This pattern would also match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">wilma
			flintstone wilma flintstone</FONT></TT>.</P>
			<P>If we wrote <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/((fred|wilma)
			(flintstone)) \2/</FONT></TT> instead, we would match strings like
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred flintstone fred</FONT></TT>; memory
			two is the choice of <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT> or
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">wilma</FONT></TT>. (Notice that it
			wouldn't match <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred flintsone wilma</FONT></TT>,
			since the backreference can match only the same name that was
			matched earlier: either <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>
			or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">wilma</FONT></TT>. But it could match
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">wilma flintstone wilma</FONT></TT>,
			since that one uses the same name.) And the pattern <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/((fred|wilma)
			(flintstone)) \3/</FONT></TT> would match strings like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred
			flintstone flintstone</FONT></TT>. It's uncommon to have a literal

			<H3><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-8-SECT-5"></A>8.5 Precedence</H3>
			<P><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-565"></A>With all of these
			metacharacters in regular expressions, you may feel that you can't
			keep track of the players without a scorecard. That's the
			precedence chart, which shows us which parts of the pattern &quot;stick
			together&quot; the most tightly. Unlike the precedence chart for
			operators, the regular expression precedence chart is simple, with
			only four levels. As a bonus, this section will review all of the
			metacharacters that Perl uses in patterns. 
			</P>
			<OL>
				<LI><P>At the top of the precedence chart are the parentheses,
				(&quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">( )</FONT></TT>&quot;), used for
				grouping and memory. Anything in parentheses will &quot;stick
				together&quot; more tightly than anything else. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>The second level is the quantifiers. These are the repeat
				operators&iuml;&frac34;â€”star (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">*</FONT></TT>),
				plus (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">+</FONT></TT>), and question mark
				(<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">?</FONT></TT>)&iuml;&frac34;â€”as well
				as the quantifiers made with curly braces, like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">{5,15}</FONT></TT>,
				<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">{3,}</FONT></TT>, and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">{5}</FONT></TT>.
				These always stick to the item they're following. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>The third level of the precedence chart holds anchors and
				sequence. The anchors are the caret (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">^</FONT></TT>)
				start-of-string anchor, the dollar-sign (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$</FONT></TT>)
				end-of-string anchor, the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\b</FONT></TT>
				word-boundary anchor, and the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\B</FONT></TT>
				nonword-boundary anchor. Sequence (putting one item after
				another) is actually an operator, even though it doesn't use a
				metacharacter. That means that letters in a word will stick
				together just as tightly as the anchors stick to the letters. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>The lowest level of precedence is the vertical bar (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">|</FONT></TT>)
				of alternation. Since this is at the bottom of the chart, it
				effectively cuts the pattern into pieces. It's at the bottom of
				the chart because we want the letters in the words in
				<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/fred|barney/</FONT></TT> to stick
				together more tightly than the alternation. If alternation were
				higher priority than sequence, that pattern would mean to match
				<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fre</FONT></TT>, followed by a choice
				of <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">d</FONT></TT> or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">b</FONT></TT>,
				followed by <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">arney</FONT></TT>. So,
				alternation is at the bottom of the chart, and the letters within
				the names stick together. 
				</P>
			</OL>
			<P>Besides the precedence chart, there are the so-called <I>atoms</I>
			that make up the most basic pieces of the pattern. These are the
			individual characters, character classes, and backreferences. 
			</P>
			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-8-SECT-5.1"></A>8.5.1 Examples of
			Precedence</H4>
			<P>When you need to decipher a complex regular expression, you'll
			need to do as Perl does, and use the precedence chart to see
			what's really going on. 
			</P>
			<P>For example, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/^fred|barney$/</FONT></TT>
			is probably not what the programmer intended. That's because the
			vertical bar of alternation is very low precedence; it cuts the
			pattern in two. That pattern matches either <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>
			at the beginning of the string or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT>
			at the end. It's much more likely that the programmer wanted
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/^(fred|barney)$/</FONT></TT>, which
			will match if the whole line has nothing but <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>,
			or nothing but <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">barney</FONT></TT>.<A HREF="#">[15]</A>
			
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[15]</SUP>
			And, perhaps, a newline at the end of the string, as we mentioned
			earlier in connection with the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$</FONT></TT>
			anchor.</P>
			<P>And what will <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">/(wilma|pebbles?)/</FONT></TT>
			match? The question mark applies to the previous character,<A HREF="#">[16]</A>
			so that will match either <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">wilma</FONT></TT>
			or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">pebbles</FONT></TT> or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">pebble</FONT></TT>,

			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[16]</SUP>
			Because a quantifier sticks to the letter <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">s</FONT></TT>

			<P><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-594"></A><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-595"></A>
			Do you remember the regular expression memories, which we used
			with backreferences in the previous chapter? Those memories are
			also available after the pattern match is done, after we return to
			Perl. They're strings, so they are kept in scalar variables with
			names like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$1</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$2</FONT></TT>.
			There are as many of these variables as there are pairs of memory
			parentheses in the pattern. As you'd expect, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$4</FONT></TT>
			means the string matched by the fourth set of parentheses. This is
			the same string that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\4</FONT></TT>
			referred to inside the pattern match. 
			</P>
			<P>Why are there two different ways to refer to that same string?
			They're not really referring to the same string at the same time;
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$4</FONT></TT> means the fourth memory
			of an already completed pattern match, while <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">\4</FONT></TT>
			is a backreference referring back to the fourth memory of the
			currently matching regular expression. Besides, backreferences
			work inside regular expressions only; once we're back in the world
			of Perl, we'll use <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$4</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P>These match variables are a big part of the power of regular
			expressions, because they let us pull out the parts of a string: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_ = &quot;Hello there, neighbor&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if (/\s(\w+),/) {             # memorize the word between space and comma</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;the word was $1\n&quot;;  # the word was there</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			Or you could use more than one memory at once:</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_ = &quot;Hello there, neighbor&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if (/(\S+) (\S+), (\S+)/) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;words were $1 $2 $3\n&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			That tells us that the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">words were Hello
			there neighbor</FONT></TT>. Notice that there's no comma in the
			output (because the comma is outside of the memory parentheses).
			That leaves the comma out of memory two. Using this technique, we
			can choose exactly what we want in the memories, as well as what
			we want to leave out. 
			</P>
			<P>You could even have an empty match variable,<A HREF="#">[9]</A>
			if that part of the pattern might be empty. That is, a match
			variable may contain the empty string: 
			</P>

			The message shows the string as <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">(Hello)(

			These automatic memory variables are what the pattern test program
			(from <A HREF="./%3Fxmlid=0-596-00132-0/lperl3-CHP-7#lperl3-CHP-7">Chapter
			7</A>) was using in its line of &quot;mystery&quot; code, to show

			Any or all of these three automatic match variables may be empty,
			of course, just like the numbered match variables. And they have
			the same scope as the numbered match variables. Generally, that
			means that they'll stay around until the next successful pattern
			match. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-9-336249"></A><A NAME="IXT-9-336250"></A>Now, we
			said earlier that these three are &quot;free.&quot; Well, freedom
			has its price. In this case, the price is that once you use any
			one of these automatic match variables anywhere in your entire
			program, other regular expressions will run a little more slowly.
			Now, this isn't a giant slowdown, but it's enough of a worry that
			many Perl programmers will simply never use these automatic match
			variables.<A HREF="#">[14]</A> Instead, they'll use a workaround.
			For example, if the only one you need is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$&amp;</FONT></TT>,
			just put parentheses around the whole pattern and use <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$1</FONT></TT>
			instead (you may need to renumber the pattern's memories, of
			course). 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[14]</SUP>
			Most of these folks haven't actually benchmarked their programs to
			see whether their workarounds actually save time, though; it's as
			though these variables were poisonous or something. But we can't
			blame them for not benchmarking&iuml;&frac34;â€”many programs that
			could benefit from these three variables take up only a few
			minutes of CPU time in a week, so benchmarking and optimizing
			would be a waste of time. But in that case, why fear a possible
			extra millisecond? By the way, the Perl developers are working on
			this problem, but there will probably be no solution before Perl

			In that example, we had five items, so there are only four colons.

			<P><A NAME="IXT-10-336282"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336283"></A>In
			order to have a more compact notation, an expression may be
			followed by a modifier that controls it. For example, the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>
			modifier works in a way analogous to an <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>
			block: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;$n is a negative number.\n&quot; if $n &lt; 0;</FONT></PRE><P>

			and curly braces:<A HREF="#">[2]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[2]</SUP> We
			also left out the line breaks. But we should mention that the
			curly-brace form does create a new scope. In the rare case that
			you need the full details, check the documentation.</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if ($n &lt; 0) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;$n is a negative number.\n&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			As we've said, Perl folks generally like to avoid typing. And the
			shorter form reads like in English: print this message, if <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$n</FONT></TT>
			is less than zero. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-10-336284"></A>Notice that the conditional
			expression is still evaluated first, even though it's written at
			the end. This is backwards from the usual left-to-right ordering;
			in understanding Perl code, we'll have to do as Perl's internal
			compiler does, and read to the end of the statement before we can
			tell what it's really doing. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-10-336285"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336286"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336287"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336288"></A>
			There are other modifiers as well: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&amp;error(&quot;Invalid input&quot;) unless &amp;valid($input);</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i *= 2 until $i &gt; $j;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot; &quot;, ($n += 2) while $n &lt; 10;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&amp;greet($_) foreach @person;</FONT></PRE><P>
			These all work just as (we hope) you would expect. That is, each
			one could be rewritten in a similar way to rewriting the
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>-modifier example earlier.
			Here is one: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while ($n &lt; 10) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot; &quot;, ($n += 2);</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			The expression in parentheses inside the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>
			argument list is noteworthy because it adds two to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$n</FONT></TT>,
			storing the result back into <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$n</FONT></TT>.
			Then it returns that new value, which will be printed. 
			</P>
			<P>These shorter forms read almost like a natural language: call
			the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&amp;greet</FONT></TT> subroutine
			for each <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">@person</FONT></TT> in the
			list. Double <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT> until it's
			larger than <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$j</FONT></TT>.<A HREF="#">[3]</A>
			
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[3]</SUP>
			Well, it helps us to think of them like that.</P>
			<P>One of the common uses of these modifiers is in a statement
			like this one: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;fred is '$fred', barney is '$barney'\n&quot;           if $I_am_curious;</FONT></PRE><P>
			By writing the code &quot;in reverse&quot; like this, you can put
			the important part of the statement at the beginning. The point of
			that statement is to monitor some variables; the point is not to
			check whether you're curious.<A HREF="#">[4]</A> Some people
			prefer to write the whole statement on one line, perhaps with some
			tab characters before the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>,
			to move it over toward the right margin, as we showed in the
			previous example, while others put the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>
			modifier indented on a new line: 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[4]</SUP> Of
			course, we made up the name <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$I_am_curious</FONT></TT>;
			it's not a builtin Perl variable. Generally, folks who use this
			technique will either call their variable <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$TRACING</FONT></TT>,
			or will use a constant declared with the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">constant</FONT></TT>
			pragma.</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;fred is '$fred', barney is '$barney'\n&quot;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">    if $I_am_curious;</FONT></PRE><P>
			<A NAME="IXT-10-336289"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336290"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336291"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336292"></A>
			Although you can rewrite any of these expressions with modifiers
			as a block (the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way), the converse isn't
			necessarily true. Only a single expression is allowed on either
			side of the modifier. So you can't write something <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>
			something <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT> something
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">until</FONT></TT> something <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">unless</FONT></TT>
			something <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT> something,
			which would just be too confusing. And you can't put multiple
			statements on the left of the modifier. If you need more than just
			a simple expression on each side, just write the code the
			old-fashioned way, with the parentheses and curly braces. 
			</P>
			<P>As we mentioned in relation to the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>
			modifier, the control expression (on the right) is always
			evaluated first, just as it would be in the old-fashioned form. 
			</P>
			<P>With the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			modifier, there's no way to choose a different control
			variable&iuml;&frac34;â€”it's always <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>.
			Usually, that's no problem, but if you want to use a different
			variable, you'll need to rewrite it as a traditional <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			loop.

			You'll often want a scalar variable to count up or down by one.

			like nearly everything else we do frequently. 
			</P>
			<P>The autoincrement operator (&quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">++</FONT></TT>&quot;)
			adds one to a scalar variable, like the same operator in C and
			similar languages: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $bedrock = 42;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$bedrock++;  # add one to $bedrock; it's now 43</FONT></PRE><P>

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my %count;                     # new empty hash</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$count{$_}++ foreach @people;  # creates new keys and values as needed</FONT></PRE><P>
			The first time through that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			loop, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$count{$_}</FONT></TT> is
			incremented. That's <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$count{&quot;fred&quot;}</FONT></TT>,
			which thus goes from <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">undef</FONT></TT>
			(since it didn't previously exist in the hash) up to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>.
			The next time through the loop, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$count{&quot;barney&quot;}</FONT></TT>
			becomes <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>; after that,
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$count{&quot;fred&quot;}</FONT></TT>
			becomes <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">2</FONT></TT>. Each time through

			done, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$count{&quot;fred&quot;}</FONT></TT>
			is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">3</FONT></TT>. This provides a quick
			and easy way to see which items are in a list and how many times
			each one appears. 
			</P>
			<P>Similarly, the autodecrement operator (&quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">--</FONT></TT>&quot;)
			subtracts one from a scalar variable:

			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $a = 5;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $b = ++$a;  # increment $a to 6, and put that value into $b</FONT></PRE><P>

			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $d = $a++;  # $d gets the old value (5), then increment $a to 6</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $e = $a--;  # $e gets the old value (6), then decrement $a to 5</FONT></PRE><P>
			It's tricky because we're doing two things at once. We're fetching
			the value, and we're changing it in the same expression. If the
			operator is first, we increment (or decrement) first, then use the
			new value. If the variable is first, we return its (old) value
			first, then do the increment or decrement. Another way to say it
			is that these operators return a value, but they also have the
			side effect of modifying the variable's value. 
			</P>
			<P>If you write these in an expression of their own,<A HREF="#">[8]</A>
			not using the value but only the side effect, there's no

			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[9]</SUP>
			Programmers who get inside the implementations of languages may
			expect that postincrement and postdecrement would be less
			efficient than their counterparts, but Perl's not like that. Perl
			automatically optimizes the post- forms when they're used in a

			The most common use of the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">for</FONT></TT>
			loop, by far, is for making computed iterations: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 10; $i++) {  # count from 1 to 10</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;I can count to $i!\n&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			When you've seen these before, you'll know what the first line is
			saying even before you read the comment. Before the loop starts,
			the control variable, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT>, is
			set to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>. Then, the loop is
			really a <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT> loop in
			disguise, looping while <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT>
			is less than or equal to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>.
			Between each iteration and the next is the increment, which here
			is a literal increment, adding one to the control variable, which
			is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P>So, the first time through this loop, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT>
			is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>. Since that's less than
			or equal to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>, we see the
			message. Although the increment is written at the top of the loop,
			it logically happens at the bottom of the loop, after printing the
			message. So, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT> becomes <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">2</FONT></TT>,
			which is less than or equal to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>,
			so we print the message again, and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT>
			is incremented to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">3</FONT></TT>, which
			is less than or equal to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>,
			and so on. 
			</P>
			<P>Eventually, we print the message that our program can count to
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">9</FONT></TT>. Then <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT>
			is incremented to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>, which
			is less than or equal to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>,
			so we run the loop one last time and print that our program can
			count to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>. Finally, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$i</FONT></TT>
			is incremented for the last time, to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">11</FONT></TT>,
			which is not less than or equal to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">10</FONT></TT>.
			So control drops out of the loop, and we're on to the rest of the
			program. 
			</P>

			The test expression (in the implied <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>

			As you've surely noticed by now, Perl is one of the so-called
			&quot;structured&quot; programming languages. In particular,
			there's just one entrance to any block of code, which is at the
			top of that block. But there are times when you may need more
			control or versatility than what we've shown so far. For example,
			you may need to make a loop like a <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>
			loop, but one that always runs at least once. Or maybe you need to
			occasionally exit a block of code early. Perl has three
			loop-control operators you can use in loop blocks to make the loop
			do all sorts of tricks. 
			</P>

			The <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">last</FONT></TT> operator
			immediately ends execution of the loop. (If you've used the
			&quot;break&quot; operator in C or a similar language, it's like
			that.) It's the &quot;emergency exit&quot; for loop blocks. When
			you hit <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">last</FONT></TT>, the loop is
			done. For example:

			<P><A NAME="IXT-10-336319"></A>There are five kinds of loop blocks

			It's probably not a good idea, but you could use these loop

			when there's no loop block running inside the subroutine, the flow

			This one is a little more complex than most of our examples up to
			this point, so let's take it step by step. The <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">while</FONT></TT>

			after another, into <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>;
			we've seen that before. Each time through that loop, another line

			</P>
			<P>Inside that loop, the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>

			with no arguments?<A HREF="#">[19]</A> That splits <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>
			on whitespace, in effect breaking <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>
			into a list of words. Since the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			loop doesn't mention some other control variable, the control
			variable will be <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>. So,
			we'll see one word after another in <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>.
			
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[19]</SUP> If
			you don't remember it, don't worry too much. Don't waste any brain
			cells remembering things that you can look up with <I>perldoc</I>.</P>
			<P>But didn't we just say that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>
			holds one line of input after another? Well, in the outer loop,
			that's what it is. But inside the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			loop, it holds one word after another. It's no problem for Perl to
			reuse <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT> for a new purpose;
			this happens all the time. 
			</P>
			<P>Now, inside the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">foreach</FONT></TT>
			loop, we're seeing one word at a time in <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$_</FONT></TT>.
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$total</FONT></TT> is incremented, so it
			must be the total number of words. But the next line (which is the
			point of this example) checks to see whether the word has any
			nonword characters&iuml;&frac34;â€”anything but letters, digits,
			and underscores. So, if the word is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Tom's</FONT></TT>,
			or if it is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">full-sized</FONT></TT>, or
			if it has an adjoining comma, quote mark, or any other strange
			character, it will match that pattern and we'll skip the rest of
			the loop, going on to the next word. 
			</P>
			<P>But let's say that it's an ordinary word, like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">fred</FONT></TT>.
			In that case, we count <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$valid</FONT></TT>
			up by one, and also <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$count{$_}</FONT></TT>,
			keeping a count for each different word. So, when we finish the
			two loops, we've counted every word in every line of input from
			every file the user wanted us to use.

			As you might expect, Perl has all of the necessary logical
			operators needed to work with Boolean (true/false) values. For
			example, it's often useful to combine logical tests by using the
			logical AND operator (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&amp;&amp;</FONT></TT>)
			and the logical OR operator (<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">||</FONT></TT>):
			
			</P>

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			There may be a shortcut. If the left side of a logical AND
			operation is false, the whole thing is false, since logical AND
			needs both sides to be true in order to return true. In that case,
			there's no reason to check the right side, so it will not even be
			evaluated. Consider what happens in this example if <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$hour</FONT></TT>
			is <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">3</FONT></TT>:

			Similarly, if the left side of a logical OR operation is true, the

			<A NAME="IXT-10-336331"></A>Because of this behavior, these
			operators are called &quot;short-circuit&quot; logical operators.
			They take a short circuit to the result whenever they can. In

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  print &quot;The average is below five.\n&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT></PRE><P>
			In that example, the right side will be evaluated only if the left

			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-10-SECT-9.1"></A>10.9.1 The Value of a

			<P><A NAME="IXT-10-336332"></A>Unlike what happens in C (and
			similar languages), the value of a short-circuit logical operator
			is the last part evaluated, not just a Boolean value. This
			provides the same result, in that the last part evaluated is
			always true when the whole thing should be true, and it's always
			false when the whole thing should be false. 
			</P>
			<P>But it's a much more useful return value. Among other things,
			the logical OR operator is quite handy for selecting a default
			value: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $last_name = $last_name{$someone} || '(No last name)';</FONT></PRE><P>
			If <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$someone</FONT></TT> is not listed in
			the hash, the left side will be <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">undef</FONT></TT>,
			which is false. So, the logical OR will have to look to the right
			side for the value, making the right side the default.<A HREF="#">[23]</A>
			We'll see other uses for this behavior later. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[23]</SUP> But
			do note that in this idiom the default value won't merely replace

			When Larry was deciding which operators to make available in Perl,
			he didn't want former C programmers to be left wishing for
			something that C had and Perl didn't, so he brought over all of
			C's operators to Perl.<A HREF="#">[24]</A> That meant bringing
			over C's most confusing operator: the ternary <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">?:</FONT></TT>
			operator. While it may be confusing, it can also be quite useful. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[24]</SUP>
			Well, to be sure, he did leave out the ones that have no use in
			Perl, such as the operator that turns a number into the memory
			address of a variable. And he added several operators (like the
			string concatenation operator), which make C folks jealous of
			Perl.</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-10-336337"></A>The ternary operator is like an
			if-then-else test, all rolled into an expression. It is called a
			&quot;ternary&quot; operator because it takes three operands. It
			looks like this: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">expression ? if_true_expr : if_false_expr</FONT></PRE><P>
			First, the expression is evaluated to see whether it's true or
			false. If it's true, the second expression is used; otherwise, the
			third expression is used. Every time, one of the two expressions
			on the right is evaluated, and one is ignored. That is, if the
			first expression is true, then the second expression is evaluated,
			and the third is ignored. If the first expression is false, then
			the second is ignored, and the third is evaluated as the value of
			the whole thing. 
			</P>
			<P>In this example, the result of the subroutine <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&amp;is_weekend</FONT></TT>
			determines which string expression will be assigned to the
			variable: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $location = &amp;is_weekend($day) ? &quot;home&quot; : &quot;work&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
			And here, we calculate and print out an average&iuml;&frac34;â€”or
			just a placeholder line of hyphens, if there's no average
			available: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $average = $n ? ($total/$n) : &quot;-----&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;Average: $average\n&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
			You could always rewrite any use of the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">?:</FONT></TT>
			operator as an <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT> structure,
			often much less conveniently and less concisely: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $average;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if ($n) {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  $average = $total / $n;</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">}</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;Average: $average\n&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
			Here's a trick you might see, used to code up a nice multiway
			branch: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">my $size =</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">  ($width &lt; 10) ? &quot;small&quot;  :</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">                  &quot;extra-large&quot;; # default</FONT></PRE><P>
			That is really just three nested <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">?:</FONT></TT>
			operators, and it works quite well, once you get the hang of it. 
			</P>
			<P>Of course, you're not obliged to use this operator. Beginners

			Using Partial-Evaluation Operators</H4>
			<P><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-715"></A><A NAME="lperl3-IDXTERM-716"></A>
			These three operators that we've just seen&iuml;&frac34;â€”<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&amp;&amp;</FONT></TT>,
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">||</FONT></TT>, and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">?:</FONT></TT>&iuml;&frac34;â€”all
			share a peculiar property: depending upon whether the value on the
			left side is true or false, they may or may not evaluate an
			expression. Sometimes the expression is evaluated, and sometimes
			it isn't. For that reason, these are sometimes called
			<I>partial-evaluation</I> operators, since they may not evaluate
			all of the expressions around them. And partial-evaluation
			operators are automatically control structures.<A HREF="#">[25]</A>
			
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[25]</SUP>
			Some of you were wondering why these logical operators are being
			covered in this chapter, weren't you?</P>
			<P>It's not as if Larry felt a burning need to add more control
			structures to Perl. But once he had decided to put these
			partial-evaluation operators into Perl, they automatically became
			control structures as well. After all, anything that can activate
			and deactivate a chunk of code is a control structure. 
			</P>
			<P>Fortunately, you'll notice this only when the controlled
			expression has side effects, like altering a variable's value or
			causing some output. For example, suppose you ran across this line
			of code: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">($a &lt; $b) &amp;&amp; ($a = $b);</FONT></PRE><P>
			Right away, you should notice that the result of the logical AND
			isn't being assigned anywhere.<A HREF="#">[26]</A> Why not? 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[26]</SUP> But
			don't forget to consider that it might be a return value, as the
			last expression in a subroutine.</P>
			<P>If <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a</FONT></TT> is really less than
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$b</FONT></TT>, the left side is true,
			so the right side will be evaluated, thereby doing the assignment.
			But if <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a</FONT></TT> is not less than
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$b</FONT></TT>, the left side will be
			false, and thus the right side would be skipped. So that line of
			code would do essentially the same thing as this one, which is
			easier to understand: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if ($a &lt; $b) { $a = $b; }</FONT></PRE><P>
			<A NAME="IXT-10-336338"></A>Or maybe you'll be maintaining a
			program, and you'll see a line like this one: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">($a &gt; 10) || print &quot;why is it not greater?\n&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
			If <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a</FONT></TT> is really greater than
			ten, the left side is true, and the logical OR is done. But if
			it's not, the left side is false, and this will go on to print the
			message. Once again, this could (and probably should) be written
			in the traditional way, probably with <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">if</FONT></TT>
			or <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">unless</FONT></TT>. 
			</P>
			<P>If you have a particularly twisted brain, you might even learn
			to read these lines as if they were written in English. For
			example: check that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a</FONT></TT> is
			less than <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$b</FONT></TT>, and if it is,
			then do the assignment. Check that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a</FONT></TT>
			is more than ten, or if it's not, then print the message. 
			</P>
			<P>It's generally former C programmers or old-time Perl
			programmers who most often use these ways of writing control
			structures. Why do they do it? Some have the mistaken idea that
			these are more efficient. Some think these tricks make their code
			cooler. Some are merely copying what they saw someone else do. 
			</P>
			<P>In the same way, the ternary operator may be used for control.
			In this case, we want to assign <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$c</FONT></TT>
			to the smaller of two variables: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">($a &lt; $b) ? ($a = $c) : ($b = $c);</FONT></PRE><P>
			If <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a</FONT></TT> is smaller, it gets
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$c</FONT></TT>. Otherwise, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$b</FONT></TT>
			does.

			<P><A NAME="IXT-10-336339"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336340"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336341"></A>
			There is another way to write the logical AND and logical OR
			operators. You may wish to write them out as words: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">and</FONT></TT>
			and <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">or</FONT></TT>.<A HREF="#">[27]</A>
			These word-operators have the same behaviors as the ones written
			with punctuation, but the words are much lower on the precedence
			chart. Since the words don't &quot;stick&quot; so tightly to the
			nearby parts of the expression, they may need fewer parentheses: 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><A NAME="IXT-10-336342"></A><A NAME="IXT-10-336343"></A>
			<SUP>[27]</SUP> There are also the low-precedence <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">not</FONT></TT>
			(like the logical-negation operator, &quot;<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">!</FONT></TT>&quot;)
			and the rare <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">xor</FONT></TT>.</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$a &lt; $b and $a = $b;  # but better written as the corresponding if</FONT></PRE><P>
			<A NAME="IXT-10-336344"></A>Then again, you may need more
			parentheses. Precedence is a bugaboo. Be sure to use parentheses
			to say what you mean, unless you're sure of the precedence.
			Nevertheless, since the word forms are very low precedence, you
			can generally understand that they cut the expression into big
			pieces, doing everything on the left first, and then (if needed)
			everything on the right. 
			</P>
			<P>Despite the fact that using logical operators as control
			structures can be confusing, sometimes they're the accepted way to

			<P><A NAME="IXTR3-66"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-67"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-68"></A><A NAME="IXTR3-69"></A>

			A filehandle is the name in a Perl program for an I/O connection
			between your Perl process and the outside world. That is, it's the
			name of a connection, not necessarily the name of a file. 
			</P>
			<P>Filehandles are named like other Perl identifiers (letters,
			digits, and underscores, but they can't start with a digit), but
			since they don't have any prefix character, they might be confused
			with present or future reserved words, as we saw with labels. Once
			again, as with labels, the recommendation from Larry is that you<SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e">
			use all uppercase letters in the name of your filehandle</SPAN>&iuml;&frac34;â€”not
			only will it stand out better, but it will also guarantee that
			your program won't fail when a future (lowercase) reserved word is
			introduced. 
			</P>
			<P>But there are also six special filehandle names that Perl
			already uses for its own purposes: <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDIN</FONT></TT>,
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDOUT</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDERR</FONT></TT>,

			one's special properties.<A HREF="#">[2]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[1]</SUP> Some
			people hate typing in all-caps, even for a moment, and will try
			spelling these in lowercase, like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">stdin</FONT></TT>.
			Perl may even let you get away with that from time to time, but
			not always. The details of when these work and when they fail are
			beyond the scope of this book. But the important thing is that
			programs that rely upon this kindness will one day break, so it is
			best to avoid lowercase here.</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[2]</SUP> In
			some cases, you could (re-)use these names without a problem. But

			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-11-336347"></A><A NAME="IXT-11-336348"></A>Maybe
			you recognized some of those names already. When your program

			input stream</I>. This is generally the user's keyboard unless the
			user asked for something else to be the source of input, such as
			reading the input from a file or reading the output of another
			program through a pipe.<A HREF="#">[3]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[3]</SUP> The
			defaults we speak of in this chapter for the three main I/O

			By default, this one goes to the user's display screen, but the
			user may send the output to a file or to another program, as we'll
			see shortly. These standard streams come to us from the Unix
			&quot;standard I/O&quot; library, but they work in much the same
			way on most modern operating systems.<A HREF="#">[4]</A> The
			general idea is that your program should blindly read from <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDIN</FONT></TT>
			and blindly write to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDOUT</FONT></TT>,
			trusting in the user (or generally whichever program is starting

			<SUP>[4]</SUP> If you're not already familiar with how your
			non-Unix system provides standard input and output, see the

			equivalent to the Unix shell (the program that runs programs based

			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$ <B>./your_program &lt;dino &gt;wilma</B></FONT></PRE><P>
			That command tells the shell that the program's input should be
			read from the file <I>dino</I>, and the output should go to the
			file <I>wilma</I>. As long as the program blindly reads its input
			from <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDIN</FONT></TT>, processes it (in
			whatever way we need), and blindly writes its output to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDOUT</FONT></TT>,

			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-11-336353"></A><A NAME="IXT-11-336354"></A>And at
			no extra charge, the program will work in a <SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e"><I>pipeline</I>.</SPAN>
			This is another concept from Unix, which lets us write command
			lines like this one: 
			</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000"><SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e">$ <B>cat fred barney | sort | ./your_program | grep something | lpr</B></SPAN></FONT></PRE><P>
			Now, if you're not familiar with these Unix commands, that's okay.
			This line says that the <I>cat</I> command should print out all of
			the lines of file <I>fred</I> followed by all of the lines of file
			<I>barney</I>. Then that output should be the input of the <I>sort</I>
			command, which sorts those lines and passes them on to
			<I>your_program</I>. After it has done its processing,
			<I>your_program</I> will send the data on to <I>grep</I>, which
			discards certain lines in the data, sending the others on to the
			<I>lpr</I> command, which should print everything that it gets on
			a printer. Whew! 
			</P>
			<P>But pipelines like that are common in Unix and many other
			systems today because they let you put together a powerful,
			complex command out of simple, standard building blocks. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-11-336355"></A><A NAME="IXT-11-336356"></A>There's
			one more standard I/O stream. If (in the previous example)
			<I>your_program</I> had to emit any warnings or other diagnostic
			messages, those shouldn't go down the pipeline. The <I>grep</I>
			command is set to discard anything that it hasn't specifically
			been told to look for, and so it will most likely discard the
			warnings. Even if it did keep the warnings, we probably don't want
			those to be passed downstream to the other programs in the
			pipeline. So that's why there's also the <I>standard error stream</I>:
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDERR</FONT></TT>. Even if the standard
			output is going to another program or file, the errors will go to

			The first one opens a filehandle called <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">CONFIG</FONT></TT>

			will be opened and whatever it holds will come into our program

			line had a shell redirection like <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&lt;dino</FONT></TT>.
			In fact, the second example uses exactly that sequence. The second
			does the same as the first, but the less-than sign explicitly says
			&quot;this filename is to be used for input,&quot; even though

			in filenames. If <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$name</FONT></TT> holds
			a user-chosen filename, simply opening <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$name</FONT></TT>
			will allow any of these magical characters to come into play. This
			could be a convenience for the user, or it could be a security
			hole. But opening <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&quot;&lt;$name&quot;</FONT></TT>
			is much safer, since it explicitly says to open the given name for
			input. Still, this doesn't prevent all possible mischief. For more
			information on different ways of opening files, especially when
			security may be a concern, see the perlopentut manpage.</P>

			Although you don't have to use the less-than sign to open a file
			for input, we include that because, as you can see in the third
			example, a <SPAN STYLE="background: #94bd5e">greater-than sign
			means to create a new file for output</SPAN>. This opens the
			filehandle <TT><TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">BEDROCK</FONT></TT></TT>
			for output to the new file <I>fred</I>. Just as when the
			greater-then sign is used in shell redirection, we're sending the
			output to a new file called <I>fred</I>. If there's already a file
			of that name, we're asking to wipe it out and replace it with this
			new one. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-11-336361"></A>The fourth example shows how two
			greater-than signs may be used (again, as the shell does) to open
			a file for appending. That is, if the file already exists, we will
			add new data at the end. If it doesn't exist, it will be created
			in much the same way as if we had used just one greater-than sign.
			This is handy for log files; your program could write a few lines
			to the end of a log file each time it's run. So that's why the
			fourth example names the filehandle <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">LOG</FONT></TT>

			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">close BEDROCK;</FONT></PRE><P>
			Closing a filehandle tells Perl to inform the operating system
			that we're all done with the given data stream, so any last output
			data should be written to disk in case someone is waiting for
			it.<A HREF="#">[8]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[8]</SUP> If
			you know much about I/O systems, you'll know there's more to the
			story. Generally, though, when a filehandle is closed, here's what
			happens. If there's input remaining in a file, it's ignored. If
			there's input remaining in a pipeline, the writing program may get
			a signal that the pipeline is closed. If there's output going to a
			file or pipeline, the buffer is flushed (that is, pending output
			is sent on its way). If the filehandle had a lock, the lock is
			released. See your system's I/O documentation for further details.</P>
			<P>Perl will automatically close a filehandle if you reopen it
			(that is, if you reuse the filehandle name in a new <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">open</FONT></TT>)
			or if you exit the program.<A HREF="#">[9]</A> Because of this,
			many simple Perl programs don't bother with <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">close</FONT></TT>.
			But it's there if you want to be tidy, with one <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">close</FONT></TT>
			for every <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">open</FONT></TT>. In general,

			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[9]</SUP> Any
			exit from the program will close all filehandles, but if Perl
			itself breaks, pending output buffers won't get flushed. That is
			to say, if you accidentally crash your program by dividing by
			zero, for example, Perl itself is still running. Perl will ensure
			that data you've written actually gets output in that case. But if
			Perl itself can't run (because you ran out of memory or caught an
			unexpected signal), the last few pieces of output may not be
			written to disk. Usually, this isn't a big issue.</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[10]</SUP>
			Closing a filehandle will flush any output buffers and release any
			locks on the file. Since someone else may be waiting for those
			things, a long-running program should generally close each
			filehandle as soon as possible. But many of our programs will take
			only one or two seconds to run to completion, so this may not
			matter. Closing a filehandle also releases possibly limited
			resources, so it's more than just being tidy.</P>
			<H4><A NAME="lperl3-CHP-11-SECT-2.2"></A>11.2.2 Bad Filehandles</H4>
			<P>Perl can't actually open a file all by itself. Like any other
			programming language, Perl can merely ask the operating system to
			let us open a file. Of course, the operating system may refuse,
			because of permission settings, an incorrect filename, or other
			reasons.

			If you try to read from a bad filehandle (that is, a filehandle
			that isn't properly open), you'll see an immediate end-of-file.
			(With the I/O methods we'll see in this chapter, end-of-file will
			be indicated by <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">undef</FONT></TT> in a
			scalar context or an empty list in a list context.) If you try to
			write to a bad filehandle, the data is silently discarded. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-11-336367"></A>Fortunately, these dire

			warnings with <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">-w</FONT></TT>, Perl will
			generally be able to tell us with a warning when it sees that
			we're using a bad filehandle. But even before that, <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">open</FONT></TT>
			always tells us if it succeeded or failed, by returning true for
			success or false for failure. So you could write code like this:

			<P>When a fatal error happens inside Perl (for example, if you

			You may not have known it, but every program that runs on Unix
			(and many other modern operating systems) has an exit status,
			telling whether it was successful or not. Programs that run other
			programs (like the <I>make</I> utility program) look at that exit
			status to see that everything is running correctly. The exit
			status is just a single byte, so it can't say much; traditionally,
			it is zero for success and a nonzero value for failure. Perhaps
			one means a syntax error in the command arguments, while two means
			that something went wrong during processing and three means the
			configuration file couldn't be found; the details differ from one
			command to the next. But zero always means that everything worked.
			When the exit status shows failure, a program like <I>make</I>
			knows not to go on to the next step.

			<P><A NAME="IXT-11-336391"></A><A NAME="IXT-11-336392"></A><A NAME="IXT-11-336393"></A><A NAME="IXT-11-336394"></A>
			By default, if you don't give a filehandle to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print</FONT></TT>
			(or to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">printf</FONT></TT>, as everything
			we say here about one applies equally well to the other), the
			output will go to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDOUT</FONT></TT>.
			But that default may be changed with the <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select</FONT></TT>
			operator. Here we'll send some output lines to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">BEDROCK</FONT></TT>:
			
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select BEDROCK;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;I hope Mr. Slate doesn't find out about this.\n&quot;;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print &quot;Wilma!\n&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
			Once you've selected a filehandle as the default for output, it
			will stay that way. But it's generally a bad idea to confuse the
			rest of the program, so you should generally set it back to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDOUT</FONT></TT>
			when you're done.<A HREF="#">[18]</A> 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm"><SUP>[18]</SUP> In
			the unlikely case that <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">STDOUT</FONT></TT>
			might not be the selected filehandle, you could save and restore
			the filehandle, using the technique shown in the documentation for
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select</FONT></TT> in the perlfunc
			manpage. And as long as we're sending you to that manpage, we may
			as well tell you that there are actually two builtin functions in
			Perl named <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select</FONT></TT>, and both
			covered in the perlfunc manpage. The other <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select</FONT></TT>
			always has four arguments, so it's sometimes called &quot;four-argument
			<TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select</FONT></TT>&quot;. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="IXT-11-336395"></A><A NAME="IXT-11-336396"></A>Also by
			default, the output to each filehandle is buffered. Setting the
			special <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$|</FONT></TT> variable to <TT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">1</FONT></TT>
			will set the currently selected filehandle (that is, the one
			selected at the time that the variable is modified) to always
			flush the buffer after each output operation. So if you wanted to
			be sure that the logfile gets its entries at once, in case you
			might be reading the log to monitor progress of your long-running
			program, you could use something like this: 
			</P>
			<PRE><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select LOG;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">$| = 1;  # don't keep LOG entries sitting in the buffer</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">select STDOUT;</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000"># ... time passes, babies learn to walk, tectonic plates shift, and then...</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">print LOG &quot;This gets written to the LOG at once!\n&quot;;</FONT></PRE><P>
