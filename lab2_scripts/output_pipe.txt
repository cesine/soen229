<CONTENT> Why
would you do that? You are probably searching for database replication,
which is quite a complicated procedure and is not directly connected to
phpBB support, which is provided here.

<CONTENT> What
you are trying to achieve will not be run by the phpBB scripts, but
instead would use some other server script or software, which is more
sophisticated for this.The topic you linked just randomly
switches database users, which still access the same database.
Maintaing two database connections or replicating the data to another
database is a whole other story.
